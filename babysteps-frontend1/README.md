# BabySteps - Prenatal Care Appointment System (Frontend)

## Overview

BabySteps is a web application for managing appointments for a prenatal care service. This project allows users to select doctors, book appointments, and manage upcoming appointments through a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Doctor Selection**: Display a list of doctors with their photos and specialties.
- **Calendar/Slot View**: A calendar allows users to select a date, and available time slots for that day are shown.
- **Appointment Booking**: After selecting a date and slot, users can book appointments by entering patient details, appointment type, and notes.
- **Appointment Management**: List and manage existing appointments, allowing users to edit or cancel appointments.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A library for implementing Material Design components in React.
- **Day.js**: A lightweight library for working with dates.
- **MUI X Date Pickers**: A collection of components to display and interact with dates.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
````

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the development server

Once dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will launch the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## File Structure

```
/src
  /components
    App.js                 # Main application component
    Home.js                # Doctor selection and booking component
    AppointmentManagement.js # Appointment listing, editing, and cancellation
  /pages
    Home.js                # Doctor selection, booking, and calendar UI
    AppointmentManagement.js # Appointment list and edit functionalities
  /assets
    images/                # Doctor photos and any static assets
  index.js                 # Entry point for the app
  App.css                  # Custom styles (if any)
```

## How to Use

1. **Doctor Selection**: Click on any doctor card to select a doctor.
2. **Booking Appointment**: After selecting a doctor, you can choose a date from the calendar and select an available time slot. Fill out the form to complete the appointment booking.
3. **Manage Appointments**: View all upcoming appointments, with the ability to edit or cancel them by clicking on the respective buttons.

## Development Notes

- The app uses local state management with React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- Components are organized by their functionality to ensure clarity and maintainability.
- Material-UI is used for a clean, responsive user interface.

## Future Improvements

- Backend integration for persistent data storage (appointments, doctors, etc.).
- User authentication to allow users to manage their personal appointments.
- Calendar and slots dynamically fetched from the backend.
